## Project Name
News Explorer

## Project Description
The idea of the application is for users to have a platform to find the latest news of their choice! A user types a keyword or topic in the search bar, sends message to api, and the api gives you back many news articles to satisfy the users want of news.

## Updates
I want to improve this website for there to be a section for legitimate news journals and journalists to add certain articles. There would have to be some type of authentication to make sure it was a proper news business creating the news but I think that would be pretty cool.
